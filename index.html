                <strong>David Martinez</strong> is the main protagonist
                of <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk:_Edgerunners" target="_blank">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>. He became
                a <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Mercenary">mercenary</a> and a member of <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Maine" target="_blank">Maine's</a>
                crew, and was later involved in a series of
                harrowing events that resulted in his
                death and attaining the status of a
                <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Night_City" target="_blank">Night City</a> legend.
            </p>
           
            <h2 class="styled-heading">Appearance</h2>
            <p class="description">David Martinez was an American teenager of Latino descent. He had light brown eyes and dark brown hair that he wore in a quaffed hairstyle, with the sides shaved. At the start of the series, he had a thin athletic build, but developed a heavier build with time. 
                David's typical style was <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Kitsch" target="_blank">Kitsch</a>, sporting a black t-shirt, two golden chain necklaces (the bottom one with a cross), gray cropped sweatpants with two yellow straps on the sides, and white tennis shoes with blue straps.    
                Later on, he started to wear his deceased mother's <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_EMT_Jacket" target="_blank">yellow EMT jacket</a>, which had a blue luminescent material on the inner lining of the collar, and a bright green Edgerunners emblem painted on the back.
                David gradually added more implants to his body, becoming taller and more muscular. While keeping his overall outfit intact, he no longer wore a black shirt, preferring to remain bare-chested when not covered by the EMT jacket.

            <h2 class="styled-heading">Biography</h2>
           
            <h3 class="subheading">Early Life</h3>
            <p class="description">
                David Martinez was born in Night City under extraordinary circumstances, delivered by his mother, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Gloria_Martinez" target="_blank">Gloria</a>, an <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Medtech" target="_blank">EMT</a>, in the back of an ambulance. He was raised by his mother in the difficult and dangerous <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Santo_Domingo" target="_blank">Santo Domingo</a> district, residing in <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Megabuilding_H4" target="_blank">Megabuilding H4</a>.
                From a young age, David felt he was destined for a significant future, which led to a fascination with the hazards and key figures, such as edgerunners, in his neighborhood.
                This curiosity extended to cyberware, leading him to befriend a local <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Ripperdoc" target="_blank">ripperdoc</a>. A defining incident in his youth, where he demonstrated remarkable resilience during a violent confrontation,
                earned him a unique reputation among locals, who viewed him as exceptional. Leveraging her position, Gloria enabled David to enroll in the prestigious <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Arasaka_Academy" target="_blank">Arasaka Academy</a>.
                Despite this academic opportunity, David felt socially alienated from his affluent peers. To navigate this environment, he began illicitly acquiring and selling <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/XBD" target="_blank">XBDs</a> to other students.
            </p>
           
            <h3 class="subheading">A Day in the Life</h3>
            <p class="description">David experienced significant financial and social pressures at Arasaka Academy, culminating in an incident where his malfunctioning braindance equipment 
                disrupted a class, leading to a confrontation with <a href= "https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Katsuo_Tanaka" target="_blank">Katsuo Tanaka</a>, the son of an Arasaka executive. The academy's principal suggested David did not fit in, and his mother, 
                Gloria, agreed to pay for the damages.
                Tragically, while driving home, David and Gloria were caught in the crossfire of a gang attack, resulting in a severe crash. Gloria was critically injured, 
                but the responding <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Trauma_Team" target="_blank"> Trauma Team</a> refused her service due to a lack of premium insurance. David managed to get her to a budget clinic. While sorting through her belongings, 
                he discovered she had salvaged a valuable, military-grade <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/David%27s_Experimental_Sandevistan" target="_blank">Sandevistan</a> implant from a cyberpsycho's body.Following a violent assault by Tanaka, David received news
                that his mother had passed away. Overcome with grief and angered by mocking messages from Tanaka, David went to his ripperdoc and demanded the Sandevistan be implanted 
                into his own body. The doctor warned that the hardware was dangerously powerful and could induce psychosis, but ultimately agreed to perform the operation under 
                the condition that he could reclaim the implant for free if David could not handle it.
            </p>
           
            <h3 class="subheading">Becoming an Edgerunner</h3>
            <p class="description">Following his augmentation, David returned to Arasaka Academy, used the Sandevistan to incapacitate Katsuo Tanaka, and was subsequently formally expelled.
                He soon encountered <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Lucyna_Kushinada" target="_blank">Lucy</a>, a netrunner stealing data <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Shard" target="_blank">shards</a> on the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/NCART" target="_blank">NCART</a> train. After intercepting her attempt to steal from him, the two agreed to partner. This partnership led David to 
                Lucy's apartment, where he was confronted by her mercenary crew <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Maine_(Edgerunners)" target="_blank">Maine</a>, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Dorio" target="_blank">Dorio</a>, and <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Pilar" target="_blank">Pilar</a>. The Sandevistan implant David possessed was originally intended for Maine, procured by 
                David's late mother. However, upon witnessing David's exceptionally high tolerance for the military-grade <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberware" target="_blank">cyberware</a>, Maine offered him a position on the crew.
                David began working as an edgerunner, taking jobs from the fixer <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Faraday" target="_blank">Faraday</a>. The crew's operations proved hazardous, resulting in the death of their crewmate Pilar during an 
                encounter with a <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpsycho" target="_blank">cyberpsycho</a>.The crew’s next major assignment from Faraday was to target Tanaka. David provided crucial intelligence, suggesting they could lure Tanaka by 
                leveraging his desire for rare braindances from the editor, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Jimmy_Kurosaki" target="_blank">Jimmy Kurosaki</a>. The resulting attempt to kidnap Kurosaki failed initially; Kurosaki captured David and subjected 
                him to intense psychological torture via a custom braindance.After being rescued by his crew, David received a warning from Kurosaki about the dangers of excessive cyberware, 
                which David dismissed, confident in his special tolerance. The operation climaxed when Tanaka arrived, leading to a confrontation that resulted in Kurosaki's death.
            </p>
        
            <h3 class="subheading">Maine's and Dorio's Deaths</h3>
            <p class="description">After Tanaka's abduction, the crew leader, Maine, began exhibiting severe mental degradation due to excessive cyberware. He resisted appeals from his partner,
                 Dorio, to downgrade his implants and experienced a preliminary episode of cyberpsychosis, attacking a crew member.During a subsequent operation where Lucy was performing a deep dive 
                 on Tanaka, Maine's condition became a critical liability. When Tanaka flatlined, their position was compromised, alerting Trauma Team and the NCPD. David evacuated an unconscious Lucy 
                 while Maine and Dorio stayed behind to fight.In the ensuing conflict, Maine fully succumbed to cyberpsychosis, losing all control and killing Dorio. David attempted to return to save 
                 his mentor, but Maine, in a final moment of lucidity, ordered him to leave. Maine then detonated a cache of explosives, sacrificing himself to eliminate the responding <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/MaxTac" target="_blank">MaxTac</a> forces.
                This event profoundly influenced David. He retrieved Maine's cybernetic arms and, inspired by his mentor's perceived values despite his tragic end, resolved to adopt Maine's heavily 
                augmented physique and philosophy.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">David's Rises</h3>
            <p class="description">Several months after Maine's death, David assumed leadership of the crew. He significantly augmented his physique with cyberware similar to Maine's, including Gorilla Arms
                 and a Projectile Launch System, and adopted a calmer demeanor.He led a successful hostage rescue operation for the fixer <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Wakako_Okada" target="_blank">Wakako Okada</a>, though a new recruit, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Julio" target="_blank">Julio</a>, was killed after 
                 disregarding David's instructions. Concurrently, his partner, Lucy, had retired from active mercenary work but continued to live with him.During a visit to his ripperdoc, David's high
                tolerance for extreme cyber-modification was noted, drawing a comparison to the infamous Adam Smasher. David dismissed the warning.Following this, crew member Kiwi arranged a meeting
                 for David with the fixer Faraday. At the same time, Lucy requested David accompany her on a trip outside Night City, where she prepared to reveal her closely guarded past.
                </p>
            
            <h3 class="subheading">Tragedy and Concerns from David's Crew</h3>
            <p class="description">David's mental state began to significantly deteriorate after he killed a civilian secretary who resembled his mother, an act that caused him profound regret and initiated 
                a loss of his sense of self. This trauma manifested during his next job when he froze, requiring his crewmate, Rebecca, to intervene to save his life. <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca" target="_blank">Rebecca</a> expressed concern for his mental 
                health and advised him to reduce his cyberware.Subsequently, David suffered a physical collapse and was taken to his ripperdoc. The doctor recommended a cyberware downgrade, which triggered 
                a violent, emotionally unstable reaction from David, who was frustrated by his circumstances and the doctor's financial practices. After apologizing, David was given immunosuppressant drugs
                instead, along with a stark warning that the medication was only a temporary measure and his path to full cyberpsychosis was now guaranteed.This decline extended to his personal life.
                Lucy confronted David about his excessive augmentation, but he refused to downgrade. While he admitted to the civilian casualty and his mental health struggles, he also suggested 
                they end their relationship, which deeply distressed Lucy. Unbeknownst to him, Lucy continued her private efforts to protect him from Arasaka. 
                </p>
            
            <h3 class="subheading">Faraday's Trap and David's Revenge</h3>
            <p  class="description">Without David's knowledge, the fixer Faraday abducted Lucy and then assigned David's crew a job to attack an Arasaka convoy. This was a complex trap orchestrated by Faraday 
                to gain favor with Arasaka. The convoy's cargo, a <a href ="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Prototype_Arasaka_Cyberskeleton" target="_blank">prototype cyberskeleton</a>, was bait intended to draw out <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Militech" target="_blank">Militech forces</a>, allowing Arasaka to field-test the hardware using David as the pilot.
                Faraday used a faked call from Lucy to manipulate David into equipping the cyberskeleton. The real Lucy briefly escaped, contacted David, and exposed the entire plan, but she was recaptured 
                just as Faraday taunted David, sending him into a rage. Simultaneously, the crew was betrayed by Kiwi, who escaped.Empowered by the cyberskeleton but suffering severe mental degradation, 
                David single-handedly annihilated the responding Militech armada. He then led his remaining crew, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Falco" target="_blank">Falco</a> and Rebecca, on a direct assault on Arasaka Tower to rescue Lucy.
                Upon arriving, David confronted Faraday and his Arasaka contact. He used the cyberskeleton's anti-gravity weaponry to fatally incapacitate Faraday. However, just as David was about to
                 kill the Arasaka executive, the infamous Adam Smasher intervened, initiating a direct confrontation.
                </p>
            
            <h3 class="subheading">Final Battle and Fate</h3>
            <p  class="description">David successfully escaped Arasaka Tower with Lucy, though Adam Smasher inadvertently killed Faraday while pursuing them. David's sanity continued to deteriorate, 
                but a final moment of lucidity, prompted by Lucy, solidified his resolve to ensure she escaped and achieved her dream of reaching the Moon, accepting his own death was imminent.
                At the tower's base, they reunited with Falco and Rebecca. David privately tasked Falco with protecting Lucy. Adam Smasher attacked the group, instantly killing Rebecca and disabling the others.
                David re-engaged Smasher, sacrificing himself to create an opening for Falco and Lucy to flee. Smasher overpowered David, systematically destroying the cyberskeleton. Before executing him,
                Smasher commented that David might have made an interesting <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Engram" target="_blank">construct</a>  a notion David dismissed. Smasher then killed David, who died content in the knowledge that Lucy was safe.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Legacy</h3>
            <p class="description">Lucy wrote "You didn't take me to the moon, but you were there with me" on David's niche in the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/North_Oak_Columbarium" target="_blank">North Oak Columbarium</a>. At some point after, Lucy fulfilled her dream of
                 making it to the Moon, while seeing a vision of David similar to their first braindance experience together. David Martinez' exploits became a popular topic around Night City in what was 
                 left of 2076, framing him as one of the local legends. The media tried to pin the damage around <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Center_(2077)" target="_blank">Corporate Center</a> to a terrorist attack caused by unknown perpetrators, but rumors circulating 
                 around the metropolis reassured some residents it had been instead the last stand of David, who had quickly risen to prominence in the previous year.
                 In 2077, a mercenary by the name of <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/V" target="_blank">V</a> encountered the braindance of Lt. Col. <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/James_Norris" target="_blank"> James Norris</a> at <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Megabuilding_H4" target="_blank">Megabuilding H4</a>, with an addendum warning that the BD was a "cautionary tale" that David did
                 not heed. After watching it, V's curiosity piqued, contacted <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Muamar_Reyes" target="_blank">Muamar Reyes</a> while wishing to know more about David. 24 hours later, Falco contacted V via text message, briefly talking about
                  his experiences with David and his crew, noting that David and V share similarities, but stating that his crew's "15 minutes were up" and not to come looking for them. However,
                  Falco then informed V to visit Muamar, as Falco had a left a package with him—<a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/David%27s_Jacket" target="_blank">David's Jacket</a>, a final parting gift from one edgerunner to another.
